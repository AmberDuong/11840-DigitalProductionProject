The project revolves around an imaginary situation involving a made-up client, Dip & Sip tea brand. The tasks include designing the brand identity with tea box packaging, and building a website. It consists of 105 hours of work, divided into 5 stages: planning, brand design, web design, web development and finalising. 

The Dip & Sip (DNS) Website is an e-commerce website designed for DNS Tea Brand. It includes Home page, Product page, About Page, Contact Page and Shopping Cart.

- The Homepage includes an overview of products with a call-to-action, a summary of the brand value, best-selling products, and customer reviews.
- The product page showcases the 6 tea products with descriptions, ingredients, and images. Customers can add them to their cart.
- The About page includes the brand's story and value, accompanied by images. It also includes a short FAQs section.
- The Contact page provides users with the brand's contact information, and a contact form for sending inquiries.

One of the key features that sets the DNS website apart from regular e-commerce websites is its unique approach to user interaction. Unlike traditional websites, DNS offers a variety of layouts and incorporates smooth scrolling and hovering animations, creating an engaging and immersive experience for site users. This innovative design not only enhances user engagement but also showcases the website's commitment to providing a dynamic and visually appealing platform for online shopping.

I not only successfully created a website that closely resembles the prototypes but also improved the design. Although coding is not my strength, I applied the knowledge I had and conducted further research to bring the ideas to life.

During the process, I found myself spending more time than expected on the web design stage and revisiting the prototypes multiple times to adjust and improve the layouts. This resulted in an extended timeline.

The only error that I couldn't fix on the website is in the shopping cart. It doesn't display the shopping items and total price correctly. If I had more time, I could have revisited it and conducted further research to resolve the problem.

Overall, I am quite happy with the final product. This project has showcased my skills and knowledge of the two courses: Visual Communication Design and Interaction Design.
